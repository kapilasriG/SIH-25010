## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
This idea is to create a mobile app or chatbot that helps small farmers by giving easy and useful farming tips in their own language. The app will use smart technology to suggest the best crops to grow, how to take care of the soil, and which fertilizers to use. It will also send alerts about weather changes, pests, and diseases that may harm the crops. Farmers can even upload photos of their plants if they see any problems. The app will share current crop prices and has a voice feature to help farmers who cannot read well. By collecting feedback from users, the app will keep improving to give better advice over time.

## Technical Approach
Programming Language: Python (for AI, backend logic) and Dart (for Flutter mobile app).

Frontend: Flutter (for building the mobile app interface).

Backend: Firebase (for real-time database, authentication, cloud  functions) 

Database: MySQL if using a separate server backend.

Hardware: Smartphones/tablets (used by farmers), cloud servers (hosting backend and AI models).

## Feasibility and Viability
This idea can work well because many people already have smartphones, and by using simple language, the app can be made easy for all farmers to use. However, there might be problems like poor internet connection in rural areas and some farmers not being familiar with digital technology. To overcome these issues, the app can include voice instructions and allow some features to work even without internet access.

## Impact and Benefits
This solution will support farmers to increase their crop production and earn better income by giving them reliable scientific advice. It will help to cut down on extra use of fertilizers, which saves money and protects nature. Besides economic benefits, it will promote smart farming practices and empower small farmers to improve their quality of life.
